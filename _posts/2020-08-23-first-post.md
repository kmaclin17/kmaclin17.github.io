This is my **first post**.

Hey guys! My name is Kailey and I am a Senior Communication Major from Argyle, TX! I love to workout, read, and spend time with friends! Some of my favorite books I have read lately are All The Light We Cannot See, The Lost Girls of Paris, and Lilac Girls. I'm also a huge fan of netflix and over quarentine have been binge watching Criminal Minds. My favorite taco totally depends on the place, but there is a spot in Dallas that has incredible steak street tacos. 
While I am not pursuing a career in writing or "digital" writing, I think that learning how to write on the web is so important. I have always loved writing and always try to take courses that help better my writing skills and I thought this course would be a great way to do that! 
I am excited to learn more through this course and get to read everyones blog posts! 

Oh and also, here is a webiste I love (shameless plug) https://www.a21.org/index.php?site=true!
