{"origin": "#Once upon a time#, there was a beautiful girl named Wendy who lived in the woods with her grandmother, until one day she decided to leave. 
 
As Wendy was leaving home her grandmother warned her to never go to the #magical# river as there were many dangers there. 
 
However, Wendy was determined to prove to her grandmother that she was strong and not afraid of the #magical# river. So, Wendy made her way to the #magical# river and when she gets there she meets the #magical# #wizard# Harry. Little does she know Harry is not who she thinks he is. 
 
Harry quickly befriends Wendy and begins granting her #magical# wishes while trying to learn who she really is. 
 
Soon, Harry realizes that Wendy is in fact the princess of Utopia that has been locked away in the woods to keep her away from him. 
 
Harry continues to befriend Wendy as they make their way to Utopia. 
 
Without knowing it Wendy is giving the #magical# #wizard# more power as he is granting the princesses wishes.  
 
On their way to Utopia Wendy realizes Harry may not be who she thinks he is because he angrily #destroyed# a house that was in the road on their way to Utopia. 
 
Wendy immediately runs to the #destroyed# house and begins to treat the injured in the surrounding area. 
 
After helping the injured Wendy decides it would be best if she went back to her grandmothers in the woods. 
 
 However, Harry had different plans and used his #magical# powers to take Wendy as his #captive#. 
 
Little did Harry know that Wendy has powers of her own, she just didn’t know it yet. As Wendy tries to escape Harry’s clutches she discovers her #magical# powers and is able to fight Harry. 
 
Wendy waits for the right moment when they reach Utopia to launch her attack on Harry. When they begin fighting the #villagers# of Utopia realize who it is fighting and immediately call the palace guards. As the guards arrive Harry strikes a blow on Wendy and she is down for the count. Then Wendys long lost brother comes from behind and #vanquishes# Harry. 
 
Wendy is then reunited with the family she didn’t know she had and is told that she is actually the princess of Utopia. 
 
Wendy tells her newfound family that they have to get her grandmother from the woods, but as she says this a fairy flys down and is revealed to be her grandmother. 
 
After learning that all these years her grandmother in the woods was really her #fairy godmother# designated to keep her safe until her powers kicked in. 
Wendy then meets her long lost brother’s friend Adam, who is instantly smitten with the princess. 
 
A few months later...Wendy and Adam are set to get married as she is going to be #coronated# queen after her parents unexpectedly died in a tragic #boat accident#. 
 
#And they lived happily ever after#.
